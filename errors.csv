The 207 (Multi-Status) status code provides status for multiple independent operations.
The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV:propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly.

The 304 (Not Modified) status code indicates that a conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 (OK) response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false.
The 305 (Use Proxy) status code has been deprecated due to security concerns regarding in-band configuration of a proxy.
The 306 status code is unused and reserved.
The 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.
The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.
"The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)."
The 401 (Unauthorized) status code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
The 402 (Payment Required) status code is reserved for future use.
The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.  A server that wishes to make public why the request has been forbidden can describe that reason in the response payload (if any).
The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.
The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target resource.
"The 406 (Not Acceptable) status code indicates that the target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent, and the server is unwilling to supply a default representation."
"The 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) status code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself in order to use a proxy."
The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did not receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.
The 409 (Conflict) status code indicates that the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.
The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target resource is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent.
The 411 (Length Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length.
The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server.
The 413 (Payload Too Large) status code indicates that the server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is refusing to service the request because the request-target (Section 5.3 of [RFC7230]) is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
The 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code indicates that the origin server is refusing to service the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource.
The 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) status code indicates that none of the ranges in the request's Range header field (Section 3.1) overlap the current extent of the selected resource or that the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or overlapping ranges.
The 417 (Expectation Failed) status code indicates that the expectation given in the request's Expect header field could not be met by at least one of the inbound servers.
The 418 (I'm a teapot) status code indicates that an attempt was made to brew coffee with a teapot. The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout.
The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code indicates that the request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. 
"The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions."
The 423 (Locked) status code means the source or destination resource of a method is locked.
The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that action failed.
The 425 (Too Early) status code indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.
The 426 (Upgrade Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.
The 428 (Precondition Required) status code indicates that the origin server requires the request to be conditional.
"The 429 (Too Many Requests) status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (""rate limiting"")."
The 431 (Request Header Fields Too Large) status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large.
The 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons) status code indicates that the server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.
The 500 (Internal Server Error) status code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
The 501 (Not Implemented) status code indicates that the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
"The 502 (Bad Gateway) status code indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request."
"The 503 (Service Unavailable) status code indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay."
"The 504 (Gateway Timeout) status code indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server it needed to access in order to complete the request."
"The 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) status code indicates that the server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP that was used in the request message."
"The 506 (Variant Also Negotiates) status code indicates that the server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process."
The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.
"The 508 (Loop Detected) status code indicates that the server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request with ""Depth: infinity""."
The 510 (Not Extended) status code indicates that the policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request.
